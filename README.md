# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

run_analysis.R file contains in this repository does all the cleaning and transofrmation work.

To do the analysis you need to open the run_analysis.R into RStudio and run line by line. Also note that it is assumed that the data is already been downloaded and extracted into "UCI HAR Dataset" directory on the root of your Working Directory.

I have used the data.table package to perform all the loadings and processing as it is recommended to use data.table for fast reading and transofrmation of larget data sets into R.

run_analysis.R is quite self explanatory with abundance of commenting within file to elaborate and explain each and every cleaning and transofrmation action taken during the project.
